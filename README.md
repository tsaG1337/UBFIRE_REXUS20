# FireTamer
This is the ground station software for the UB-FIRE REXUS 20 flight computer

The code for the ADC-Board (MCU) is using the Arduino framework and is (mostly) written in C.

The groundstation software is written using the QT-framework version 5.7. 
Due to the fact that QT can compile for different development environements, the software can be compiled for Windows, Mac or Unix.
